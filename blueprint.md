# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a static-first web application for a fictional creative agency, built with Astro.js. It's designed to be a fast, performant, and content-focused website that showcases the agency's work, team, and services.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Layout:** A single-column layout with a header, main content area, and footer.
*   **Styling:** Minimal styling is in place, with some basic CSS for the hero section, grids, and cards.

### Features

*   **Content Collections:** The project uses Astro's content collections to manage blog posts, team members, and services.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Dynamic routes are set up for individual blog posts, team members, and services.
*   **Pages:**
    *   `src/pages/index.astro`: The homepage, featuring a hero section.
    *   `src/pages/about.astro`: The "About Us" page, displaying team members.
    *   `src/pages/services/index.astro`: The "Services" page, listing the agency's offerings.
    *   `src/pages/blog/index.astro`: The blog listing page.
    *   `src/pages/portfolio.astro`: A static "Portfolio" page.
    *   `src/pages/contact.astro`: A static "Contact" page.
*   **Components:**
    *   `src/layouts/Layout.astro`: The main layout component, including the header and footer.
    *   `src/components/Header.astro`: The site header with navigation.
    *   `src/components/Footer.astro`: The site footer.
    *   `src/components/Card.astro`: A reusable card component for displaying content previews.
*   **Content:**
    *   `src/content/config.ts`: The content collection configuration file.
    *   `src/content/blog/`: Contains markdown files for blog posts.
    *   `src/content/team/`: Contains markdown files for team members.
    *   `src/content/services/`: Contains markdown files for services.

## Current Plan

### TypeScript Error Resolution

*   **Problem:** The project was encountering TypeScript errors (`Parameter '...' implicitly has an 'any' type.ts(7006)`) in several files. This was happening because the type of the variables in the `.map()` functions and `getStaticPaths` functions were not being automatically inferred.
*   **Solution:** I have resolved these errors by explicitly importing the `CollectionEntry` type from `astro:content` and applying it to the following variables:
    *   `service` in `src/pages/services/index.astro`
    *   `post` in `src/pages/blog/index.astro`
    *   `member` in `src/pages/about.astro`
    *   `entry` in `src/pages/services/[slug].astro`
    *   `entry` in `src/pages/team/[slug].astro`
    *   `entry` in `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro`
*   **Outcome:** All TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the application is now in a runnable and correct state.
